Homework: Grids!

I made a grid using for loops. Initially I misunderstood the instructions, and increase the number of squares vertically, imitating a grid look. But I soon realized that this was not what was asked in the instruction, and went on to learn about lines and loops.
My first attempt in using for loops for lines turned out like this. I derived the code from the squares, which only required a single square() function to let squares appear in lines vertically and horizontally (x and y axis). However, this method did not work as the lines turned out to be diagonal in one direction, instead of intersecting into a grid.
