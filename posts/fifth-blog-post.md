### **Visual**

Ngai’s definition of cuteness highlights **smallness, softness, and an appeal to care**, but cuteness can also be **bold and striking**. My sketch reflects this through color and decorative elements. 

- **Bright, saturated neon colors** that aren’t just soft but also energetic and attention-grabbing, mirroring the way cute aesthetics create a strong visual presence.
- **Decorative stickers as self-expression**, referencing how high school girls in early 2000s Japan used photobooths (purikura) to claim agency over their identity and aesthetics (as a part of decorative maximalist culture), which is still a significant part of culture amongst young girls.
- **A sense of organized chaos**, where stickers can be placed freely, reflecting the layered, maximalist, and unapologetic nature of cute aesthetics.

### **Sonic**

- Instead of just being gentle, **playful sound effects (like beeps, pops, or sparkles) can feel energetic and iconic**, similar to how early 2000s tech (flip phones, game consoles) had their own sonic identity that shaped nostalgia.
- A mix of **cute and assertive sounds** (e.g., a high-pitched “ding” paired with a punchy click) could reinforce how cuteness isn’t just passive but dynamic and engaging.
- **Ambient sound** of the arcade and the photobooth machine that shapes the surroundings and gives the environment setting a sense of integrity and immersion.

### **Interactive**

Ngai describes how **cute objects invite handling and interaction**, but in my work, this interaction also represents **agency and power**:

- **Users actively decorate and customize**, just like high school girls in purikura booths, transforming the screen into their own expressive space.
- **Stickers appear with energy**—instead of simply being placed, they "pop" into existence, showing how cute aesthetics can be bold and attention-commanding.
- **The randomization of colors and sizes adds spontaneity and excitement**, reflecting the playful rebellion within cute culture—where layering, excess, and personal flair break traditional design norms.
- **simplicity:** Rozendaal’s websites are often **single-action experiences** (hovering, clicking) that transform the screen. My sticker interaction follows a similar principle—one simple action (clicking) generates surprising, joyful results.
