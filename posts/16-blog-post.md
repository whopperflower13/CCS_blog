With the help of my classmates, I was able to brainstorm some ideas of how the work can achieve chaotic and zany in the looks, interaction, and sound.

chaotic in a zany way brainstorm

- avatar escapes, sleeping
- avatar starts eating food lunch break
- appearance:
- glitch idea: z-fighting

zany interaction brainstorm

- buttons that dont do what they say
- error looking animation ? ZZZ
- who doesnt like confetti
- doubleclick → fisheye
- greenscreen?

zany sound

- transition/button sound effect
- normal and glitchy voice
- girl → old man
