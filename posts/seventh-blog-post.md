I mainly discussed my plan on achieving the cute aesthetic register through visual, sonic, and interactivity in my previous blog, so I will cover the conceptual aspects my work in related to cuteness that add on to my previous discussion.

### **Reframing Cuteness as Influence and Power**

Rather than just focusing on vulnerability, my sketch highlights how cuteness has shaped personal and collective identities over time. It nods to the way cute aesthetics are actually deeply influential, shaping fashion, design, and digital culture even today. The motif of a photobooth can be interpreted as a symbol of soft power. The edit process unique to purikuras provide a Kawaii culture experience to edit photos under Japanese values of beauty, which later influence filters and edits on selfie culture.


### **Color & Cuteness in My Work**

- Color palette: Like Rozendaal, I used saturated, electric colors that shift and contrast sharply, evoking both digital nostalgia and an assertive sense of cuteness.
- Flat and vibrant design: Inspired by Rozendaal’s ability to create depth through color rather than shading, my stickers pop through color contrast rather than intricate detail, reinforcing their bold presence. I intentionally deformed the quality of the stickers by running through a pixel image editor.
- Interactive simplicity: Rozendaal’s websites are often single-action experiences (hovering, clicking) that transform the screen. My sticker interaction follows a similar principle using clicks to generate joyful results.

By combining Rozendaal’s color sensibilities with the expressive, maximalist energy of high school purikura culture, my work positions cuteness not just as soft or nostalgic, but as a force of bold visual impact and personal agency.
